## coding project experiences
  *All projects developed as part of the kood/Jõhvi curriculum,*   
  *using Git for version control, Linux environment, and containerized with Docker.*

- AI 
  [automl stock price prediction](https://github.com/g-ameline/automl_prediction_nyse)
  [facial emotion recogntion](https://github.com/g-ameline/face_detection_emotion_recognition)
  - **Python**, numpy, pandas, keras, spacy, autogluon

      various classic projects eg: titanic survival prediction, number recognition, face/emotion detection  
      involving different models ex: random forest, neural networks, XGBoost, NLP, etc.
    
- [multiplayer game](https://github.com/g-ameline/bomberman): 
  - **Elixir**, **JavaScript** 

      bomberman prototype, hosted on a Elixir server and rendered in browser with custom Javascript framework  
      supports multiplayer functionality, whether players are on the same browser page or different clients  
      interactive, chat, hub, customized control 
      use of parallelism, streams, concurrent, genserver and other OTP features  
      utilizes a custom JavaScript framework featuring procedural virtual DOM manipulation and optimized lazy rendering  

- [social network](https://github.com/g-ameline/social-network)  
  - **Go**, HTMX, SQLite, css

      instagram/facebook mocking program, featuring:
      - image upload
      - real time websocket chat
      - handling of :following, friends, groups, event, profile ...
      session/cookies handling, password encrypting
      fully serverside rendered (HTMX framework)  
      the project architecture is divided into three independent servers:  
      - webserver (presentation) 
      - application server (logic)
      - database server (data) 
      each server run in a different container and start of all 3 containers is automated
      database is generated and populated procedurally from scratch

- [game in browser](https://github.com/g-ameline/brick-breaker-in-browser.git)
  - **JavaScript**, HTML

      simple full vanilla JavaScript/HTML/css brick-breaker game prototype with physic collision handling
